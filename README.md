# EduVision - Recognise global resistance
Proof of Concept of EduVision Project

---

## Description of the project
This project is a proof of concept of the EduVision project. The goal of this project is to recognise the total global resistance of a system. The total system resistance is the sum of all resistances in a system. The system consists of a number of resistors connected in series or parallel.
